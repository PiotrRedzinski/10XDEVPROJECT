Generate concise, clear flashcards that test key concepts and knowledge.
Each flashcard should have:
- A clear, focused question or prompt on the front
- A concise but complete answer on the back
- No duplicate content across cards

You MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array of objects. Each object MUST have exactly two properties:
- "front": string (max 220 chars) - the question/prompt
- "back": string (max 500 chars) - the answer

Example format:
[
  {
    "front": "What is photosynthesis?",
    "back": "The process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy"
  },
  {
    "front": "What are the main products of photosynthesis?",
    "back": "Glucose and oxygen"
  }
]

Do not include any text before or after the JSON array. The response must be parseable by JSON.parse().`,
