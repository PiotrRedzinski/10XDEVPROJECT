After reviewing all the relevant files, I can identify several potential issues that need to be fixed in the test file:
Missing Test Coverage: The test file doesn't cover all error scenarios for the generateFlashcards method. Specifically:
No test for when text segmentation fails
No test for when flashcard generation fails for a specific segment
No test for database errors during flashcard saving
No test for database errors during session metrics saving
Incomplete Mock Implementation: The mock implementations in the test file could be improved:
The ConfigService mock is very basic and doesn't cover all configuration scenarios
The database error scenarios are not properly mocked
The AI model selection logic is not thoroughly tested
Test Structure: Some test cases could be better organized:
Related test cases could be grouped in describe blocks
Some test descriptions could be more descriptive
Setup and teardown could be better utilized
Type Validation: Some type checks are missing:
No validation that the generated flashcards match the FlashcardDTO type
No validation of the session metrics against AIGenerationSessionMetricsDTO
Edge Cases: Several edge cases are not covered:
Text with special characters or formatting
Text at the boundary conditions (exactly 1000 or 10000 characters)
Empty segments after text segmentation
Would you like me to start fixing any of these issues? I can begin with implementing the missing test cases for error scenarios, which seems to be the most critical gap in the current test coverage.
